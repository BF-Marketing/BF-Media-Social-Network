# BF Media - Social Media Server Side

This project was made for the Company's (BF Marketing) portfolio.
The goal was to make an exemplar of a social media site with the basic features where users can post, like post, comment, e get views.
It was built with MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS).


This repository shows how the server-side was made. You can see the photos below or go directly to the site here: [https://bfmedia.netlify.app/](https://bfmedia.netlify.app/).
